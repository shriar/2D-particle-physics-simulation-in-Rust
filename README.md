# 2D particle physics simulation in Rust

A simple 2D particle physics simulation in Rust using [macroquad](https://github.com/not-fl3/macroquad).

## Features

- Gravity-based particle motion
- Elastic collisions between particles
- Boundary collisions with walls
- Fixed timestep physics loop

## Run

```bash
cargo run
```

## Controls

None — just watch the particles bounce!

## Dependencies

- `macroquad` — lightweight game framework
